# JACS-Deoxyfluorination Paper Tutorial

A step-by-step python codes tutorial for the [JACS paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.8b01523) by Doyle group (@Princeton University). 

Their codes of this paper are also avaiable on their group [GitHub](https://github.com/doylelab/rxnpredict), and original datasets is in the paper [Supporting Information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jacs.8b01523).

Most of these data in their project were processed by R including data processing and machine learning models training, in this tutorial, these data are all processed by python. 

The aim of this tutorial is to further practice the python coding skills from the [Science-CrossCoupling Tutorial](https://github.com/ChemxBigData/Science-CrossCoupling). 

# Prerequisites

Basic knowledges of data analysis, data mining with python. Python packages used in this tutorial include pandas, numpy, matplotlib/matplotlib.pyplot, scikit-learn. 

If you can understand codes in the [Science-CrossCoupling Tutorial](https://github.com/ChemxBigData/Science-CrossCoupling), you will have a very good start for this one.

# Software 

* Python 3.7: data analysis, machine learning

* MS Excel: quick check original data

* Anaconda: install python packages

* Jupyter Notebook: store codes

# Instructions of this tutorial

* Part1 Train RF Model with manually selected features (Page S51 - S59)

* Part2 Train RF Model with One-Hot Encoding (Page S60 - S63)
